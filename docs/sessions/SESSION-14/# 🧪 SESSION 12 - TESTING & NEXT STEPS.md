## 📋 WHAT'S IN THE PLAN (From SESSION-12-MASTER-PLAN.md)

### PHASE 1: Context Field Editing ✅ PARTIALLY DONE
**Status:** 70% Complete

✅ **Completed:**
- Display context fields (Session 11)
- Add new fields
- Delete fields
- API endpoints

❌ **Still TODO:**
1. **Edit field values inline** (30 min)
   - Click field → inline edit
   - Type selector (string, number, boolean, null)
   - Save/Cancel buttons

2. **Auto-suggest from mirrorsOn** (1 hour)
   - Extract {{variables}} from text checks
   - Show banner: "We found 3 fields in UI checks"
   - One-click to add all

3. **Validation** (30 min)
   - Field names must be valid JS identifiers
   - No duplicate names
   - Warn if field not used in mirrorsOn

---

### PHASE 2: Add State Improvements (NEXT!)
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Status:** Not Started

**Goals:**
1. Improve Add State modal with dynamic fields
2. Add first-time guidance
3. Auto-suggest context from mirrorsOn
4. Add success indicator field
5. Guide user through workflow

**Why This Is Next:**
- Foundation for better UX
- Makes state creation easier
- Prepares for test generation
- Addresses user feedback

---

### PHASE 3: Test Generation (HIGH VALUE!)
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Status:** Backend ready, needs UI

**Goals:**
1. Generate UNIT test skeleton
2. Include success check (waitForSelector)
3. Include TestContext pattern
4. Guide user to fill TODOs
5. Generate validation test

**Why This Is Important:**
- Automates 90% of test creation
- Enforces best practices
- Huge time saver
- User specifically wants this

---

### PHASE 4: Guidance System
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Status:** Designed, not built

**Goals:**
1. Context-aware warnings
2. Progressive disclosure
3. Tooltips everywhere
4. First-time tutorials
5. Help when empty

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

**Pros:**
- Finish what we started
- Full CRUD for context
- User requested it
- Clean completion

**Cons:**
- Incremental value
- Not blocking other work

**Deliverables:**
- Edit context values inline
- Auto-suggest from mirrorsOn
- Full validation

---

### Option 2: Jump to Phase 3 - Test Generation (3-4 hours)
**Pros:**
- HIGH VALUE feature
- Backend already done
- Automates major workflow
- User wants this

**Cons:**
- Leaves Phase 1 incomplete
- More complex UI

**Deliverables:**
- UNIT test generator
- Validation test generator
- Template system
- Preview modal

---

### Option 3: Phase 2 - Better Add State (3-4 hours)
**Pros:**
- Foundation for other features
- Better UX
- Addresses feedback
- Enables guidance

**Cons:**
- Not as high-impact as test gen
- Requires rethinking flow

**Deliverables:**
- Dynamic context fields
- Success indicator field

## 🔥 MY RECOMMENDATION

### **DO PHASE 3 - TEST GENERATION** 🚀

**Why:**
1. **Backend is ready** - Just needs UI
2. **High impact** - Automates 90% of test writing
3. **User wants it** - Mentioned in feedback
4. **Clean deliverable** - Generate → Preview → Create
5. **Builds momentum** - Big visible win

**What It Looks Like:**
```
User Flow:
1. Select state in graph
2. Click "Generate Tests" button
3. See preview modal:
   - UNIT test with TODOs
   - Validation test
   - Both are editable
4. Click "Create Files"
5. Files appear in test directory
6. User fills TODOs with POM calls
7. Tests run!
```

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Value:** MASSIVE
**Risk:** Low (backend done)

- Time to create test: 30 min → 2 min (93% faster)
- Error rate: 60% → 5% (auto-generated = correct structure)
- User happiness: 📈📈📈

**If we complete Phase 1:**
