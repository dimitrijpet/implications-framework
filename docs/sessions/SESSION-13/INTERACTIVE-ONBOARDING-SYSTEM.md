# 🎯 Interactive Onboarding System - Make Users Commit!

## Philosophy

**Goal:** Get users to commit to the Implications Framework by showing them how easy it is through **interactive, guided experiences** - not walls of text.

**Principle:** "Show, don't tell" + "Guide, don't force"

---

## 🚀 Three-Tier Approach

### Tier 1: First 5 Minutes (Hook)
**Goal:** User sees value immediately

```
User opens app
    ↓
Sees beautiful dashboard with:
    ✨ "Welcome! Let's build your first state machine in 5 minutes"
    ↓
Click "Start Interactive Tutorial"
    ↓
Guided overlay appears (like Product Hunt's new features)
    ↓
3 simple steps with live preview
    ↓
"🎉 You just created a state machine! Want to use it for real?"
```

### Tier 2: First 30 Minutes (Commit)
**Goal:** User creates something real in their project

```
"Great! Now let's make this work in YOUR project"
    ↓
Checklist appears:
    ☐ Copy these 4 files to your project
    ☐ Run this one command
    ☐ Tell us where your test files are
    ↓
Auto-scan shows their POMs
    ↓
"We found 12 screen objects! Let's turn one into an Implication"
    ↓
Click-through builder with their actual code
    ↓
"✅ Generated! Now run this test command to see it work"
```

### Tier 3: First Hour (Mastery)
**Goal:** User understands the patterns and can work independently

```
"Perfect! You're ready to build the rest"
    ↓
Reference guide appears (always accessible)
    ↓
+AI Assistant prompt (for when stuck)
    ↓
"Here's what to do next..." (contextual suggestions)
```

## 🎨 UI Components to Build

### 1. Welcome Screen

```jsx
<WelcomeScreen>
  <Hero>
    <h1>Welcome to Implications Framework</h1>
    <p>Structure your Playwright/Appium tests with state machines</p>
  </Hero>
  
  <TwoPathChoice>
    <Path1 recommended>
      🎓 Interactive Tutorial (5 min)
      "Never used this before? Start here!"
      
      [Start Tutorial]
    </Path1>
    
    <Path2>
      🚀 Quick Setup (30 min)
      "Familiar with state machines? Jump right in!"
      
      [Setup My Project]
    </Path2>
  </TwoPathChoice>
  
  <BottomLinks>
    <Link>📖 Read the docs</Link>
    <Link>🤖 Get AI assistant prompt</Link>
    <Link>👀 Watch 2-min video</Link>
  </BottomLinks>
</WelcomeScreen>
```

---

### 2. Interactive Tutorial (Overlay System)

**Similar to Figma/Linear onboarding**

```jsx
<TutorialOverlay step={currentStep}>
  {/* Darkens everything except highlighted element */}
  <Spotlight target="#add-state-button">
    <Tooltip position="bottom">
      <strong>Step 1: Add a State</strong>
      <p>Think of states as "positions in your workflow"</p>
      <p>Example: <code>empty</code> → <code>filling</code> → <code>published</code></p>
      
      <Actions>
        <Button onClick={nextStep}>Got it! →</Button>
        <Link onClick={skipTutorial}>Skip tutorial</Link>
      </Actions>
    </Tooltip>
  </Spotlight>
</TutorialOverlay>
```

**Steps:**
1. Click "Add State" → See modal
2. Fill in name ("login") → See validation
3. Click Generate → See file preview
4. Click "Add Transition" → Connect states
5. Done! → See complete graph

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

### 3. Setup Checklist (Interactive)

```jsx
<SetupChecklist>
  <Progress>2 / 5 complete</Progress>
  
  <Step completed={true}>
    ✅ Install framework files
    <CodeBlock>
      npm install @implications/core
    </CodeBlock>
  </Step>
  
  <Step current={true}>
    📂 Copy utility files
    <FileList>
      <File 
        name="TestContext.js" 
        action="Copy to clipboard"
        onCopy={() => copyFile('TestContext.js')}
      />
      <File name="ExpectImplication.js" ... />
      <File name="TestSetup.js" ... />
    </FileList>
    
    <HelpText>
      💡 These files help manage test data and validation
      <Link>Learn why these are needed</Link>
    </HelpText>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    🔍 Scan your project
    <Input placeholder="/path/to/your/tests" />
    <Button>Scan Now</Button>
  </Step>
  
  <Step disabled>
    🏗️ Create your first Implication
    <Badge>Unlocks after scan</Badge>
  </Step>
  
  <Step disabled>
    🧪 Generate and run test
  </Step>
</SetupChecklist>
```

### 4. Contextual Help System

**Always visible in corner:**

```jsx
<HelpButton floating>
  ❓
  
  <Menu>
    <Item>🎓 What is this page?</Item>
    <Item>🤖 Ask AI for help</Item>
    <Item>📖 Read full docs</Item>
    <Item>💬 Join Discord</Item>
    <Divider />
    <Item>🔄 Restart tutorial</Item>
  </Menu>
</HelpButton>
```

**Context-aware tooltips:**

```jsx
// When on visualizer page
<Tooltip>
  💡 This is your state machine.
  
  Each circle = a state (workflow position)
  Each arrow = a transition (how to move between states)
  
  Click any state to edit its rules!
</Tooltip>

// When adding a state
<Tooltip>
  💡 Naming convention:
  
  ✅ Good: login, pending_approval, published
  ❌ Bad: Login123, PeNdInG, handle-something
  
  Use lowercase with underscores for state names
</Tooltip>

// When editing context
<Tooltip>
  💡 Context = data that accumulates through your workflow
  
  Example for login:
  - username (string)
  - password (string) 
  - sessionToken (set after login succeeds)
  - loginTimestamp (when logged in)
</Tooltip>
```

# You are an Implications Framework Expert

## Context
User is building test automation with the Implications Framework pattern.
This separates business rules (Implications) from page actions (POMs).

## Files to understand:
[Auto-attach these from user's project]
- TestContext.js
- ExpectImplication.js
- ExampleImplication.js
- UserScreenObject.js (from their upload)

## Your job:
1. Analyze their POM (page object model)
2. Suggest Implication structure
3. Generate context fields
4. Create mirrorsOn UI expectations
5. Generate test data scenarios

## Rules:
- NEVER recreate POMs - use existing ones!
- Implications = RULES (what/when/why)
- Tests = RUNNERS (orchestration)
- Keep it simple

## Example:
[Include a complete working example]

## User's Question:
[User types their question here]

## 🎭 Tutorial Script (Full Flow)

### Act 1: The Hook (2 min)

```
[App loads, welcome screen appears]

Narrator: "Welcome! Let's see how easy it is to structure tests with state machines."

[Click "Start Tutorial"]

Spotlight on graph: 
"This is a state machine. Each circle is a 'state' - a position in your workflow."

[Auto-creates 3 nodes: idle, loading, success]

"These arrows are 'transitions' - events that move between states."

[Click Next]

Spotlight on 'idle' node:
"States have rules: what data exists, what the UI should look like."

[Shows mini preview of meta: { username: null, loading: false }]

"That's it! State machines = states + transitions + rules."

[🎉 Confetti animation]

"Ready to make one for YOUR project?"
[Yes, let's do it!] [Maybe later]
```

### Act 2: The Setup (5 min)

```
[Checklist appears]

"First, let's set up your project. This is a one-time thing."

Step 1: Copy 4 utility files
[Shows files with one-click copy buttons]
"These help manage test data and validations. Copy them to tests/utils/"

Step 2: Scan your project  
[Input field appears]
"Tell us where your test files are"
[Auto-detects if in project directory]

[Scanning... progress bar]
[Found 12 screen objects, 8 test files]

"Great! We found your screens. Let's turn one into an Implication."
```

### Act 3: The Build (8 min)

```
[Shows discovered POMs]

"Pick a screen object to start with:"
[List: LoginScreen, DashboardScreen, ProfileScreen]

[User clicks LoginScreen]

"Perfect! Let's define the LOGIN state."

Builder appears with 3 tabs:
1. States (idle, logging_in, logged_in)
2. Context (username, password, token)
3. UI Rules (what should be visible)

[Guides through each tab with examples]

"Almost there! Let's add transitions:"
[Visual connection tool]

"Click 'idle', then click 'logging_in'"
"What event triggers this? → START_LOGIN"

[Generates]

"🎉 You created LoginImplications.js!"
[Shows code preview]

"Want to generate a test too?"
[Yes!] [Not yet]

[Generates test file]

"Run this command to see it work:"
```bash
npm test login.spec.js
```

```

### Act 4: The Reveal (5 min)

```
"Here's what you just built:"

[Shows side-by-side:]
- Your POM (unchanged) ← "Handles actions"
- Your Implication (new) ← "Defines rules"
- Your Test (generated) ← "Orchestrates both"

"This separation means:
✅ Change rules without touching tests
✅ Change POMs without breaking logic
✅ Reuse rules across platforms"

[Animated diagram showing how they connect]

"You're ready! Here's what you can do now:"
1. Add more states (➕ Add State)
2. Connect states (🔗 Add Transition)
3. Edit rules (click any state)
4. Generate tests (🧪 Generate)

"Need help? Click this ❓ button anytime!"

[Tutorial complete badge unlocked]
