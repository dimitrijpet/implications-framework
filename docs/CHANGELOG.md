# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added - Smart Suggestions & Edit Modal Complete (Phase 4)
- **Smart Suggestions Panel** in Edit Modal with pattern analysis
- **Button Suggestions** - Detects naming patterns (SINGLE_VERB, VERB_OBJECT)
- **Field Suggestions** - Separates required fields vs context fields  
- **Setup Suggestions** - Shows actual function names
- **One-Click Apply** - Apply suggestions with single button click
- **Inline Field Editing** - Edit statusCode, statusNumber, buttons, etc.
- **Safe File Updates** - Whitelisted fields prevent corruption
- **Auto-Backup** - Creates timestamped backup before every save
- **Background Refresh** - Auto-scans after save
- **Success Notifications** - Beautiful green toast with backup info

### Fixed
- Missing `useEffect` import in Visualizer
- Missing state variables (`setIsScanning`, `setAnalysisResult`)
- Edit modal closing on toggle (state initialization)
- Missing `projectPath` prop to StateDetailModal
- Backend only updating existing fields (now adds new fields)
- Backend breaking complex objects (now whitelists simple fields)
- AST generation creating `[object Object]` strings

### Improved
- Pattern analyzer field separation (required vs context)
- Setup action extraction (no more `[object Object]`)
- File integrity preservation (complex objects untouched)
- UX with visual feedback (yellow border, badges, notifications)

### Performance
- Pattern analysis: ~2-3ms for 26 states
- Save operation: ~100ms with backup
- Note: Full refresh after save takes ~10s (optimization opportunity)

- Base file reads: 11 → 1 (plus 9 cache hits)
- UI accuracy: 8% → 100%
